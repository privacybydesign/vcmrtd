These hashes are collected into a structure, and then a digital signature is generated over that structure using the issuer\u2019s private key. This signed object is stored on the chip as the EF.SOD (Security Object Document) file.

If the Document Signer certificate is on the chip, the system still needs to validate that cert against the CSCA certificate it trusts. This is why countries exchange CSCA certs and/or use the ICAO PKD.

In other words, PA secures the data, not the physical chip. Also, PA doesn\u2019t protect confidentiality at all, it\u2019s purely about integrity and authenticity of data.
