PACE uses cryptographic protocols (Diffie\u2013Hellman key agreement with a shared secret derived from a password) to establish the secure session. The password can be derived from the MRZ, or it could be a PIN or a Card Access Number (CAN) printed on the document. The key point is that PACE, unlike BAC, is resistant to eavesdropping and brute-force attacks because it uses strong cryptography (typically AES encryption with a secure shared secret) and an interactive zero-knowledge proof to derive session keys. The EU required all member states to implement PACE in new passports by end of 2014. Initially, PACE was implemented alongside BAC for backward compatibility, but by 2018 BAC was made optional in the EU standards. In practice, most EU passports after 2014 support PACE (and border inspection systems prefer it), falling back to BAC only if necessary for older readers.
