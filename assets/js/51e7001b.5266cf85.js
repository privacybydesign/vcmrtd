It is specified in BSI\u2019s TR-03110 (version 1.11 in 2008) and adopted by EU member states. Starting around 2009, EU passports that include fingerprint biometrics are required to implement EAC. Under EAC, after basic BAC is done, the chip and inspection system perform Chip Authentication (to verify the chip is genuine and establish new session keys) and Terminal Authentication (to verify the inspecting terminal is authorized to access fingerprints/iris). EAC protocols and their logic are discussed in detail in the \u201cSecurity Protocols\u201d section, but essentially this added an entire Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for authorization of readers: countries issue CVCA certificates (Country Verifying Certificate Authority) and Document Verifier certificates which are used in TA. All EU member states\u2019 passports since mid-2009 support EAC (for fingerprints), making it a de facto EU standard.

SAC, defined in an ICAO technical report (first published in 2010 ), mandates PACE for third-generation e-passports. PACE uses cryptographic protocols (Diffie\u2013Hellman key agreement with a shared secret derived from a password) to establish the secure session. The password can be derived from the MRZ, or it could be a PIN or a Card Access Number (CAN) printed on the document. The key point is that PACE, unlike BAC, is resistant to eavesdropping and brute-force attacks because it uses strong cryptography (typically AES encryption with a secure shared secret) and an interactive zero-knowledge proof to derive session keys. The EU required all member states to implement PACE in new passports by end of 2014. Initially, PACE was implemented alongside BAC for backward compatibility, but by 2018 BAC was made optional in the EU standards. In practice, most EU passports after 2014 support PACE (and border inspection systems prefer it), falling back to BAC only if necessary for older readers. The presence of an EF.CardAccess file on the chip indicates PACE support, containing the parameters needed for the PACE protocol negotiation. Globally, outside the EU, some countries have also adopted PACE, but many still rely on BAC. ICAO\u2019s guidance is that for interoperability, passports implementing PACE should retain BAC as well (so that non-upgraded readers can still access them)."}),"\n"]}),"\n"]}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Overall, the EU\u2019s contributions via EAC and SAC are additional layers of security on top of ICAO\u2019s baseline.
