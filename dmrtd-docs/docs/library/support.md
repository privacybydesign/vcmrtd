The table below is a list of the intented passport model support for various countries. It includes information on whether the passport supports Basic Access Control (BAC), Password Authenticated Connection Establishment (PACE), and Active Authentication (AA). The "Tested" column indicates whether the passport model has been tested with the DMRtd library.

It uses BAC for access control but does **not** implement PACE or Active Authentication (no anti-cloning mechanism). The “Next Generation Passport” introduced in 2021 added a polycarbonate data page and new physical security features, but chip security features remain BAC-only (no PACE, no AA).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **United Kingdom** | Biometric Passport (ePassport) – introduced March 2006; **Second generation** with polycarbonate data page from 2010; **“Series C”** (blue-cover post-Brexit model) from March 2020.                                              |  ✅  |   ✅  |  ✅  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ❌                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | The UK’s ePassport includes a facial biometric (no fingerprints). All UK biometric passports use BAC and, since EU SAC mandate in 2014, also support PACE. **Active Authentication** was introduced for UK passports issued from 2015/2016 onwards to enable clone detection, so newer passports have anti-cloning capability. Older UK ePassports (2006–2015) lacked AA, but those will expire by \~2025.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

It does **not** implement PACE. **Active Authentication** *is* implemented as an anti-cloning measure – each Canadian ePassport chip has a unique public-private key pair, allowing the chip to prove it’s genuine during inspection. (Canada included AA from the start of ePassport issuance in 2013.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

BAC is supported on all series. **Active Authentication** was introduced in 2009 with the N-series passports, meaning Australian passports issued 2009 onward have anti-cloning capability. Australia has *not* adopted PACE/SAC (not required outside EU), so chips still rely on BAC for the initial key exchange. The P-series (2014) and newer R-series (2022) feature upgraded physical security (polycarbonate data page, etc.) but continue to use BAC (with AA) instead of PACE.                                                                                                                                          |

A new version unveiled in 2009 and issued from mid-2010 introduced additional security features including **Active Authentication** to detect cloned chips. NZ passports use BAC for chip access and have not implemented PACE. (Initially NZ passports had 5-year validity; since 2015 adult passports are 10-year, and those newer passports continue to support AA. No fingerprint biometric is stored in NZ passports, so EAC is not used — clone protection is via AA.)                                                                                                                                    |

The **second-generation** Austrian ePass (from mid-2009) included two fingerprints in the chip (EU mandate) and uses Extended Access Control with Chip Authentication. Austria also implemented **Active Authentication** in its ePassports, and as an EU member it introduced **PACE** (SAC) by end of 2014. Thus, modern Austrian passports support BAC and PACE for access, and they include a clone-detection mechanism (AA or Chip Auth).                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The 1st generation (2005) had a chip with the holder’s photo and supported BAC (Germany also enabled Active Authentication on early ePassports). The 2nd generation **ePass 2.0** (from 1 Nov 2007) added two fingerprint images in the chip, protected by Extended Access Control. The **third-generation ePass (ePass 3.0)** launched 1 March 2017 features a polycarbonate data page and implemented **PACE** as the sole access-control mechanism (no BAC fallback). German passports thus support PACE and have **clone detection** via Chip Authentication (and previously via AA as well), so all three security features are effectively present.     |
